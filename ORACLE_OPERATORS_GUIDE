📄 Oracle Operator Guide
Sovereign Lightning Oracle (SLO) — v1

Purpose of This Document
This guide explains how to operate an SLO oracle in v1 of the protocol.
It is written for:
infrastructure engineers


Lightning node operators


quantitative engineers


anyone already ingesting BTC price data


This guide assumes technical competence and does not attempt to simplify concepts at the expense of correctness.

What an SLO Oracle Is (and Is Not)
An SLO Oracle is
an HTTP service


that produces signed factual assertions


in a canonical format


after verifying Lightning payment


An SLO Oracle is not
a price feed API


a publisher of “the true price”


a consensus participant


a protocol authority


a trusted third party


Each oracle is independent. Clients choose which oracles to trust.

Oracle Responsibilities (v1)
As an oracle operator, you are responsible for:
Observing data


In v1: BTC/USD pricing


Using your chosen methodology


Committing to methodology


Explicit sources (e.g. exchanges)


Explicit aggregation rule (e.g. median)


Explicit time semantics


Signing canonical messages


secp256k1 signatures


Deterministic canonical formatting


Enforcing payment-before-release


No signed data without payment confirmation



What v1 Does Not Require
You are not required to:
match other oracles’ prices


provide uptime guarantees


participate in governance


register anywhere


coordinate with other operators


stake capital or tokens


You may operate anonymously or publicly.

Running the Reference Oracle (v1)
Requirements
Python 3.10+


A Lightning node (or simulated backend)


Network connectivity


Start the oracle
python oracle.py <port>

Example:
python oracle.py 8000

On startup, the oracle will print:
its public key (compressed hex)


the listening address


This public key is how clients identify you.

Endpoints (v1)
GET /quote
Requests a quote for BTCUSD data.
Returns:
domain


price (in sats)


invoice ID


Lightning invoice (or simulation)



GET /paid/{invoice_id}
Returns signed data only after payment is verified.
If payment has not occurred:
HTTP 402 is returned


no data is released


This invariant is mandatory.

Canonical Message Format
Oracles must sign messages exactly as defined in the protocol spec.
Example:
v1|BTCUSD|43250.67|USD|2|2026-02-02T16:00:00Z|890456|coinbase,kraken,bitstamp|median

Any deviation in formatting will cause clients to reject the response.

Key Management
v1 default
Keys are generated at oracle startup


Keys are held in memory


Operator options
Persist keys to disk


Use HSMs


Rotate keys manually


SLO does not prescribe key management beyond:
the public key identifies the oracle

Lightning Payments
v1 expectations
One invoice per request


Payment must be verified before release


Micropayments are acceptable and expected


Node requirements
Ability to generate invoices


Ability to detect payment settlement


Routing, channel management, and uptime are operator concerns, not protocol requirements.

Pricing Your Oracle
You may price:
cheaply (high volume, low margin)


expensively (low volume, high assurance)


differently per domain (v2+)


In v1:
pricing is per request


pricing is expressed in sats


Clients decide whether to pay.

Independence and Plurality
You are not expected to agree with other oracles.
In fact:
disagreement is a feature, not a failure.
Clients use aggregation to resolve differences.
If your oracle always matches others exactly, clients should be skeptical.

Failure Modes
If your oracle:
goes offline


returns errors


returns unexpected formats


Clients may:
exclude you


retry later


replace you


There are no penalties enforced by SLO.

Security Expectations
Oracles should:
protect private keys


validate inbound requests


avoid leaking internal state


rate-limit if necessary


SLO does not enforce security policies beyond signature verification.

Compliance and Liability
SLO:
does not make claims about correctness


does not guarantee outcomes


does not enforce SLAs


You are publishing signed assertions, not advice.

How Clients Find You (v1)
There is no global registry.
Clients may find oracles via:
documentation


recommendations


social trust


prior relationships


This is intentional.

When to Stop Operating
If you no longer wish to operate:
stop the service


clients will naturally exclude you


No coordination required.

v1 Summary
An SLO oracle:
sells signed facts


enforces payment-before-release


operates independently


competes on methodology and reliability


That’s all.

Final Note to Operators
SLO works only if:
oracles are honest about methodology


clients are explicit about trust


no one pretends there is a single “true feed”


If that resonates, you are the intended operator.
